## 🐂 The Bull Market Bistro

**The Bull Market Bistro** is a parody restaurant website that blends finance and food. It’s a fun take on what a Wall Street-themed bistro might look like — complete with stock puns, trading-inspired design, and a menu that plays off market trends.

I built the site using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, with **Webpack** and **npm** to keep everything organized and modular.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bull-market-bistro.git
