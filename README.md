## 🐂 The Bull Market Bistro

**The Bull Market Bistro** is a parody restaurant website that blends finance and food. It’s a fun take on what a Wall Street-themed bistro might look like, complete with stock puns, a menu inspired by market trends and stock tickers, and opening times that model the NYSE's.

I built the site using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, with **Webpack** and **npm** to keep everything organized and modular.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
